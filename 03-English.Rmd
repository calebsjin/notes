## Bible

### Matthew

#### Chapter 11

- 6 凡不因我跌倒的就有福了

> Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me. 

- 11 凡妇人所生的，没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的；然而天国里最小的比他还大。

> Among those of women there has not risen['rɪzn] anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

- 12 从施洗约翰的时候到如今，天国是努力进入的，努力的人就得着了。

> From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has benn forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.

- 17 我们向你们举哀，你们不捶胸

> we sany a dirge, and you did not mourn.

- 19 人子来了，也吃也喝，人又说他是贪食好酒的人

> the Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, "Here is a glutton and a drunkard". 

21 因为在你们中间所行的异能，若行在推罗、西顿，他们早已披麻蒙灰悔改了。

> If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

- 24 它还可以存到今日。但告诉你们：当审判的日子，所多玛所受的，比你还容易受呢！

> it would have remained to this day. But I tell you it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgement than for you.

- 28 凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。

> Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
